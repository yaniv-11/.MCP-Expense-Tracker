ExpenseTracker (FastMCP)DescriptionThis project is a simple, file-based expense tracker application built using the fastmcp framework. It uses an SQLite database (expenses.db) to store, manage, and query expense data. It exposes several "tools" (functions) that can be called via the FastMCP environment to add, list, update, delete, filter, and summarize expenses.FeaturesAdd Expenses: Record new expenses with date, amount, category, subcategory, and notes.List Expenses: Retrieve a list of all expenses within a specified date range.Update & Delete: Modify or remove existing expense entries by their unique ID.Detailed View: Fetch all details for a single expense by its ID.Filtering: Filter the expense list by category and/or subcategory.Summarization: Get a summary of total spending by category within a date range.Category Management: Loads expense categories from an external categories.json file.RequirementsPython 3.xfastmcp: pip install fastmcpsqlite3 (included in the Python standard library)Setup & InstallationClone the repository or save the code:Save the code as main.py.Install dependencies:The only external dependency is fastmcp.Bashpip install fastmcp
Create categories.json:In the same directory as main.py, you must create a file named categories.json. This file defines the valid categories and subcategories for your expenses. The application reads this file to provide category information via the expense://categories resource
   
This will start the FastMCP service. The script will automatically create the expenses.db SQLite database file in the same directory if it doesn't already exist.Database SchemaThe application uses an SQLite database file named expenses.db with a single table: expenses.Table: expensesColumnTypeConstraintsDescriptionidINTEGERPRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENTUnique identifier for the expense.dateTEXTNOT NULLDate of the expense (e.g., "YYYY-MM-DD").amountREALNOT NULLThe monetary value of the expense.categoryTEXTNOT NULLThe main category (e.g., "Food").subcategoryTEXTDEFAULT ''The optional subcategory (e.g., "Groceries").noteTEXTDEFAULT ''An optional text note for the expense.API / Tools ReferenceThe following tools and resources are exposed by the FastMCP application.add_expenseAdds a new expense entry to the database.Tool Name: add_expenseParameters:date (str): The date of the expense (format YYYY-MM-DD).amount (float): The expense amount.category (str): The main category.subcategory (str, optional): The subcategory.
